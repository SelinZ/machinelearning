# Machine Learning Challenge of Tilburg University

In this challenge the task is to predict the number of citations a scientific paper
receives based on its abstract and metadata.

## ISSUES

Under [issues](https://github.com/happyfuntimegoup/machinelearning/issues), we can create about different tasks that we're working on and issues we have encountered (e.g. an funtion that supposedly works for one person, doesn't work for the other). 
If a function/assignment is completed, you can close the issues, so we all know it has been completed. An update on Whatsapp would also be appreciated! :)

## Features

In the upcoming days, Albert will open a number of issues; each issues specifically for an individual feature. Features will be based on the current literature (i.e. what current citation prediction models have been using as predictors). 
Some of them might end up not being used, as we will need to see if they are actually useful for our models (i.e. see if the addition of a feature explains a significant % of the data correctly).

## Tasks
We can update each other about current tasks that we came up with. Use strikethrough ('\~~(text)\~~') to show it has been completed.
- Albert:
  -  ~~Function to split train dataset into train & validation set.~~
  -  Open issues for individual feature extractions/creations.
